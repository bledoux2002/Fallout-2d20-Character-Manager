## Roadmap

- FIX RECURSION ISSUES, instead of calling main, function ends and goes back to begining of first while loop, whoul be while choice != 4.

- Flesh out creator.py, give menu options functionality (creating new characters, customizing stats, selecting perks, etc.)

- Integration of saving and exporting/importing characters, likely using JSON format, medium priority, shouldn't be overly difficult

- Complete Perks list in `data.json`, low priority, enough already to use for dev purposes.

- Complete Equipment Packs list in `data.json`, low priority. Requires logging of all in-game items.

- Begin website development and integration, low priority, implement as local program first.
